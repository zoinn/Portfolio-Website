# Portfolio-Website
This is my FE (React JS) and BE (Django) for my portfolio website - www.zainsiu.com (Hosted on Render.com as its free) 

WIP

# What I Learned and Improved On
- Django
- DjangoRest
- React
- React Spring
- Animations in website development
- MUI for the modern look
- Deploying a website to AWS & Render (Ended up using render as its free forever) for a custom domain
- Git for version control for a consistent workflow
- Integrating Django into React so they work seamlessly
